### 💡 Why This Matters  
In real-world analytics, data is often **sensitive** (e.g., customer records, internal company KPIs).  
A good analyst knows:  
- **When to share data**  
- **When to withhold it**  
- **How to document work transparently**  

This project demonstrates not only **technical analysis** but also **ethical data handling**.
